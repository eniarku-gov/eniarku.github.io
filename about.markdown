**Eniarku**, officially the **Grand Duchy of Eniarku**, is an autonomous micronation claiming sovereignty over several contiguous territories in continental North America. Founded on 29 May 2009 when the Republic of Eniarku declared independence from the United States of America, the nation is an enclave of the Midwestern U.S. state of Michigan and has experienced numerous structural and territorial changes throughout its history. The current grand duchy was officially established by the nation's first codified constitution on 29 May 2024, fifteen years after its original establishment.

The grand duchy operates as a semi-constitutional monarchy, in which the national constitution explicitly vests political power and governing authority in the reigning grand duke while simultaneously defining the limits of those powers. The current monarch, Grand Duke Alexander, fulfills the various constitutional responsibilities of the Crown on the advice of and together with the Council of State, which is appointed by the sovereign and functions as a privy council; there are no separate legislative or judicial institutions. As a unitary state, Eniarku's territorial subdivisions (known as cantons) do not possess any devolved governmental powers of their own and are administered directly by the grand duke and his advisors from the capital of Glenora.


## The Monarchy

The grand duchy operates as a semi-constitutional monarchy, in which the national constitution explicitly vests political power and governing authority in the reigning grand duke while simultaneously defining the limits of those powers. The monarch's title is *Grand Duke* (if male) or *Grand Duchess* (if female). The current sovereign is Grand Duke Alexander, who ascended to the throne upon the enactment of the constitution on 29 May 2024. In addition to functioning as the fount of political power and governing authority of the state, the grand duke (and his family) undertake various ceremonial and representative duties as well.


## The Council of State

The Council of State is the formal body of advisors to the grand duke and the other primary component of the Government. The Council is composed of officials appointed directly by the sovereign and functions as a privy council with no direct governing power of its own, but rather advises and assists the grand duke in jointly fulfilling various institutional responsibilities delegated to the Crown by the constitution. For example, Article 24 of the constitution establishes the grand duke's institutional role of the "Crown-in-Council" when he is actively chairing the Council of State in its lawmaking capacity, while Article 31 authorizes the council to convene as the "Crown Council of Appeal," which can operate as both a trial court or an appellate court to maintain the rule of law in the name of the sovereign.
