**BALDWIN HOUSE, Glenora** â€” Together with the Council of State, HRH The Grand Duke has enacted the Diplomatic Expansion Act (A.S. 2406), designed to be Eniarku's most ambitious diplomatic endeavor since its early years and the first of a series of planned outreach programs to reinvigorate relations with the Community. The new law calls for the creation of a dozen new treaties with various "nations of interest" that the Government has identified as key players in the contemporary Community, which will be distributed within the next 30 days and tracked in a central database.

When asked about the new diplomatic campaign following the announcement, Grand Duke Alexander noted that "\[t\]he Grand Duchy, in its previous forms, was incredibly isolationist and engaged actively with few other nations. The goal of this program and those that follow is to begin a new chapter of warmer relations with nations around the globe, one that hopefully is beneficial for all."

To complement the Diplomatic Expansion Act, the Government has also begun work on a new law regarding Eniarku's citizenship policies, which is expected to permit non-residents to apply for citizenship for the first time in the nation's history via an online portal to submit documentation. Also in the drafting stage are two laws that, according to several councillors of state, are designed to form the backbone of Eniarku's first formalized criminal and civil codes. Some members of the Council of State have also expressed interest in proposing novel firearms and drug control laws, but these have yet to be presented to HRH The Grand Duke in a formal meeting of the Council.

The Government is also set to begin updating and testing new modules on its website, including an online database of the *Corpus Juris*, the comprehensive collection of the Grand Duchy's laws.
